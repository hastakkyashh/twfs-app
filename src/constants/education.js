    title: "What is an SIP?",
    content: "A Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) allows you to invest small amounts periodically (monthly, quarterly) in a mutual fund scheme. It works on the principle of Rupee Cost Averaging, buying more units when markets are low and fewer when high."

  {
    title: "Power of Compounding",
    content: "Compounding is the process of earning interest on interest. As investment returns are reinvested, they generate incremental gains that build upon themselves. Over extended periods (10–15+ years), this mathematical phenomenon can scale modest monthly savings into a significant fortune, often totaling in the crores."
  },
  {
    title: "Equity vs. Inflation",
    content: "Inflation erodes the purchasing power of money. Traditionally, Equity Mutual Funds have been one of the few asset classes to consistently beat inflation over the long term, thereby preserving and growing your real wealth."
  },
  {
    title: "Why Start Early?",
    content: "If you start investing at age 25 vs age 35, the difference in your final corpus at retirement can be massive, even if the investment amount is the same. Time in the market is more important than timing the market."

  {
    title: "The First Step: Emergency Fund",
    content: "Before you start investing, you must have a safety net. An emergency fund is 3–6 months of living expenses parked in a savings account or liquid fund. It prevents you from breaking your long-term investments during unexpected crises like job loss or medical issues."

  {
    title: "Insurance is for Protection, Not Investment",
    content: "The primary goal of insurance is to manage risk, not to generate wealth. Mixing the two often leads to inadequate coverage and poor returns. Use insurance to protect your family's future income (Term Life) and health, and use separate investment products to grow wealth."
  },
  {
    title: "What is Term Life Insurance?",
    content: "This is the purest form of life insurance. You pay a small premium for a large cover (e.g., ₹1 Crore) for a specific period (term). If you pass away during this term, your nominees get the money. If you survive the term, you get nothing back. It is essential for anyone with dependents."
  },
  {
    title: "Why You Need Personal Health Insurance",
    content: "Even if your employer provides cover, it ceases when you leave the job or retire, often when you need it most. With rising medical inflation, a personal health insurance policy ensures that a single hospitalization doesn't wipe out years of your hard-earned savings."
  },
  {
    title: "Asset Allocation (Don't put all eggs in one basket)",
    content: "Successful investing isn't just about buying stocks. It's about spreading your money across different asset classes like Equity (for growth), Debt/Fixed Income (for stability), and Gold (for a hedge). This balances risk and smooths out the ups and downs of the market."
  },
  {
    title: "Understanding Risk vs. Reward",
    content: "In finance, higher potential returns almost always come with higher risk. Equities offer high growth potential over 10 years but can be volatile in the short term. Fixed Deposits offer safety but low returns that may not beat inflation. Your investment choice should match your goal's timeline."
